== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is Frontis Gutenberg Blocks Free? =
Yes, it's completely free.

= Is Frontis Blocks compatible with my theme? =  
Yes, the core Gutenberg editor is free in WordPress, and Frontis Blocks extends its functionalities at no extra cost. 

= What Is the Difference Between Gutenberg Blocks and Elementor? =  
Gutenberg blocks are native to WordPress, offering a lightweight and more streamlined approach without needing an external page builder. Elementor, on the other hand, is a separate plugin with its own editor. Frontis Blocks leverages Gutenberg’s built-in capabilities and transforms it into a powerful, easy-to-use design framework—no need to juggle multiple page builders.

= Is Gutenberg a Page Builder? =  
Many people ask this question because of the editor’s block-based approach. While Gutenberg started as a basic content editor, with robust add-ons (like Frontis Blocks, or other block plugins), it can function similarly to a traditional page builder. That means advanced layout controls, design customizations, and a wide array of elements—right inside the familiar WordPress interface.
